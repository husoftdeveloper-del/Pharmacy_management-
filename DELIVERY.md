`src/pages/Pharmacy-Setup.exe` is the same Setup installer and has the same SHA-256 as `Pharmacy-1.0.0-x64.exe`.

## Purchase form fix

Build 17 keeps the purchase-form fix and `Invalid record ID` when receiving a purchase. adds a visible `build.17` label plus field-specific ID errors. The purchase form explicitly maps supplier, medicine, location, invoice, payment method and account fields to the secure IPC contract. The same naming mismatch was corrected in related payment, expense, staff, transfer, stock-count and prescription forms. Cash/bank account choices now follow the selected payment method, and credit purchases hide the irrelevant account field.

## Live-reload development mode

Run `npm run dev` (or double-click `dev.bat` on Windows) after one `npm ci`. Saving `src/` files refreshes the open window; saving `main.js`, `preload.js`, `package.json` or `database/` restarts Electron. Build 17 ignores read-only Windows file-watch events and resumes the dev session after a renderer refresh, so navigating between pages no longer forces logout. Dev mode uses a separate `Pharmacy Management Dev` data folder and is disabled in packaged EXEs.

## Barcode update

Barcode Management now has an icon button inside the barcode input. Clicking it generates a unique `MED-…` barcode through the secure main process, fills the input, and shows the CODE128-B preview immediately. Choose a medicine and press Save to assign it; Print remains available after preview. The action is permission-checked in the main process and covered by database and Electron smoke tests.

## Verification completed

- 17 database/business-rule and form-payload tests passed, including the purchase-form regression, barcode uniqueness and permission checks.
- JavaScript syntax and strict technology checks passed.
- Real Electron smoke test on Windows passed: 26 module screens, renderer Node isolation, one-click barcode generation/preview, visible build label, purchase form submissions for credit/cash/bank, POS cart and sale, PDF generation, persistent login data, Pashto RTL and dark preferences.
- Electron Builder produced both Windows Setup and Portable EXEs.
- Successful Windows workflow: https://github.com/husoftdeveloper-del/Pharmacy_management-/actions/runs/41287564313

The EXEs were built and verified by the Windows CI job. Interactive installation, physical scanner/printer testing, native file-picker workflows and a real-pharmacy acceptance run remain required; they are not claimed as completed here.

This is a working first release with documented boundaries, not certified medical/accounting software. Review README before production use.
